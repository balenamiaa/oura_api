      # Overview   The Oura API allows Oura users and partner applications to improve their user experience with Oura data.  This document describes the Oura API Version 2 (V2), which supports access to the latest Oura Ring data types.  For access to other data types—which have not yet migrated to V2—refer to the [Oura API Version 1 (V1)](https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/) documentation.  # Data Access  Individual Oura users can access their own data through the API by using a [Personal Access Token](https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens).  If you want to retrieve data for multiple users, a registered [API Application](https://cloud.ouraring.com/oauth/applications) is required.  API Applications are limited to **10** users before requiring approval from Oura. There is no limit once an application is approved.  Additionally, Oura users **must provide consent** to share each data type an API Application has access to.  All data access requests through the Oura API require [Authentication](https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/authentication).  Additionally, we recommend that Oura users keep their mobile app updated to support API access for the latest data types.  # Authentication  The Oura API provides two methods for Authentication: (1) the OAuth2 protocol and (2) Personal Access Tokens. For more information on the OAuth2 flow, see our [Authentication instructions](https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/authentication).  Access tokens must be included in the request header as follows: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;http GET /v2/usercollection/personal_info HTTP/1.1 Host: api.ouraring.com Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  # Oura HTTP Response Codes  | Response Code                        | Description | | ------------------------------------ | - | | 200 OK                               | Successful Response         | | 400 Query Parameter Validation Error | The request contains query parameters that are invalid or incorrectly formatted. | | 429 Request Rate Limit Exceeded        | The API is rate limited to 5000 requests in a 5 minute period. You will receive a 429 error code if you exceed this limit. [Contact us](mailto:api-support@ouraring.com) if you expect your usage to exceed this limit.|
